## Base Ambassadors

<Info>
**Base Ambassadors** are passionate members of the Base community who work closely with **Country Leads** to grow and support the Base Community.
</Info>

Ambassadors are carefully selected volunteers who act as cornerstones of the community. Many Ambassadors also provide support for builders - which can include mentorship, networking opportunities and amplification on social media.

<Tip>
Although Ambassadors are not employed by or agents of Base, they do work closely with the core team and are eligible for our [Builder Grant program](https://paragraph.com/@grants.base.eth/calling-based-builders).
</Tip>

### Important Guidelines

<Warning>
The views and opinions expressed by each Base Ambassador are their own and do not represent the views and opinions of others, including Base.
</Warning>

We expect each Base Ambassador to maintain a friendly, safe, supportive and harassment-free environment. Base Ambassadors shall not defame, disparage, or commit an act that would be considered offensive to the general community, or otherwise bring Base by association into disrepute, contempt, scandal, or ridicule or otherwise post anything that is not accurate.

We may immediately prohibit or suspend an individual's participation in the Base Ambassador Program at any time if there is a failure to comply with these guidelines, or for any or no reason, without notice or liability of any kind.
