title: How to host Flashblocks-aware RPC nodes
sidebarTitle: Node Providers
---

## Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites**:
  - Docker and Docker Compose
  - Minimum hardware requirements (see [node README](https://github.com/base/node?tab=readme-ov-file#hardware-requirements))
  - Access to a Flashblocks websocket endpoint, we provide public endpoints in the env files in the repo

2. **Set Up Environment**:

  ```sh
  # Clone the repository
  git clone https://github.com/base/node.git
  cd node
  ```

3. **Start the Node with Flashblocks Support**:

  ```sh
  NODE_TYPE=base CLIENT=reth docker-compose up
  ```

## Configuration Options

- Node Type: Use `NODE_TYPE=base` to enable base reth node with Flashblocks functionality
- Network: Use `NETWORK_ENV=.env.mainnet` for mainnet or `NETWORK_ENV=.env.sepolia` for testnet

## Verifying Flashblocks Functionality

Test that your node is properly supporting Flashblocks by querying a pending block:

```sh
curl -X POST \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBlockByNumber","params":["pending", false],"id":1}' \
  http://localhost:8545
```

## Available RPC Methods

Flashblocks-aware nodes provide all standard Ethereum JSON-RPC methods plus specialized Flashblocks endpoints. For more details, see the [Flashblocks RPC API documentation](/base-chain/flashblocks/apps#rpc-api).

## Further Resources

For detailed information about node setup, including hardware requirements and additional configuration options, refer to the [Reth node README](https://github.com/base/node/tree/main/reth#readme).
